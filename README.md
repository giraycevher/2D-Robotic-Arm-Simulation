# 2D-Robotic-Arm-Simulation
MATLAB simulation of 2-link planar robot with trajectory planning and dynamics analysis

A comprehensive MATLAB simulation of a 2-link planar robotic arm with trajectory planning, kinematics, and dynamics analysis.


Trajectory Planning: 5th-order polynomial, S-curve, and Double S-curve methods
Forward/Inverse Kinematics: Geometric solution for 2-DOF planar arm
Inverse/Forward Dynamics: Lagrangian formulation with mass, centripetal, and gravity matrices
Comparative Analysis: Performance comparison of trajectory generation methods
Visualization: Real-time animation and result plotting
