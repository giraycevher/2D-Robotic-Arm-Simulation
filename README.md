Project Title: 2-Link Planar Robotic Arm Simulation

 Project Overview :
 This project provides a comprehensive MATLAB-based framework for simulating a 2-DOF planar robotic arm. It integrates kinematic solvers with rigid dynamic analysis to simulate  robotic maniupulator.

 
 Key Technical Modules:
 Trajectory Planning: Implementation of 5th-order polynomials, S-Curve, and Double S-Curve algorithms to ensure smooth, jerk-limited motion profiles.
 Kinematics: precise geometric solutions for Forward Kinematics (end-effector position) and Inverse Kinematics (joint angle calculation).
 Dynamics: Full dynamic modeling using the Euler-Lagrange formulation, accounting for the Mass Matrix M(q), Centripetal/Coriolis effects C(q,q˙​), and Gravity vectors    
 G(q).
 Visualization: Real-time animation of the arm coupled with comparative plotting of torque, velocity, and acceleration data.


Supervision and Mentorship :
This project was developed under the expert supervision of Raşit Muhammed Evdüzen.
Role: Technical Mentor & Major Contributor.
Contribution: He provided foundational guidance on the control theory architecture and made significant contributions to the implementation of the dynamic modeling  algorithms. His mentorship was pivotal in ensuring the analytical accuracy of the simulation.
